# TimeLapseGenerator
This is a program which launches an instance of rome total war and runs a campaign with the AI controlling every faction so there is no human involvement. It lets the campaign run for a set amount of turns and collects data that is then used to generate a timelapse visualizing the army movements, conquests, and battles of the AI.
